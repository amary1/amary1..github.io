                    <p class=" h5 text-primary">Havana Brown</p>
                    <p>Havana Brown is a rare breed and is highly appreciated by cat lovers. Now no one can answer for sure where this breed name came from, because, in fact, Havana brown is a Swiss mountain cat. Moreover, the breed originated from Asia, from Siamese cats. As you can see, the history of havana Brown cats is full of intricacies, but here are some irrefutable facts.</p>
                    <div class="media mt-3">
                        <div class="ingredient-list">
                            <p class=" h5 text-primary">Description</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The havana brown cat is rare in the feline world, and you should understand this. If you keep her in a private home, you need to make sure that your pet is not abducted. On the other hand, being the owner of such a unique breed is a special pleasure.

                                    Havana Brown has a deep character, gets attached to close people, but distrusts strangers. Loves to play, loves affection and attention, and gives them away with a vengeance.

                                    Outwardly, these cats have an elongated skull, large ears, and an intelligent look. They can be attributed to medium-sized breeds, with a developed but elegant body. Life expectancy is from 10 to 15 years.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The Havana Brown breed has a short coat, so the care of these pets is quite simple. Usually, it is enough to brush them once a week to remove dead hairs, and bathe at least once a month. It is better, of course, to bathe once every two weeks, but here you decide for yourself.

                                    The claws are trimmed once a week, it is advisable to brush your teeth every day, but if this is not possible, at least make it a rule to monitor your pet's oral cavity at least 3 times a week. The ears are cleaned once a week.</li>

                <div class="media-body">
                    <p class=" h5 text-primary">Bambino</p>
                    <p>Bambino is a new breed of cats, the so-called "designer", bred in 2005. Its official recognition is the subject of constant disputes between international organizations and cat lovers. In fact, the bambino breed is a cross between a Canadian sphinx and a Munchkin.</p>
                    <div class="media mt-3">
                        <div class="ingredient-list">
                            <p class=" h5 text-primary">Description</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Since the main distinguishing feature of the animal is short paws, these cats are also called "dwarf cat" or "dwarf cat". At the same time, they have relatively large ears. Externally, bambino cats look very unusual, have charm and all their movements are as unusual as the first impression they make. They really look very much like touching babies.

                                    The body size is small, the tail is rat-like, the skin feels like velvet. That is, in fact, these cats are not completely bald. They are wonderful companions, selflessly devoted to their family, playful and simple-minded. We can say that the Bambino breed has a real cat's heart.</li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="instruction-list">
                            <p class=" h5 text-primary">Care</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Bambino cat breed needs careful care, first of all - for their skin. The fact is that the secretions of the sebaceous glands are not absorbed by the wool, which means they settle in the folds of the skin and can cause irritation. Therefore, cats should be bathed regularly (on average 2 times a week), as well as wipe the folds of the skin. Also, do not forget about other "cat" procedures: it is advisable to brush your teeth at least every other day, trim your claws once a week and keep your ears clean.

                                    Another important point is that short paws impose restrictions, and the house needs to be adapted by making something like a natural ladder to high surfaces (cabinets, sofas, etc.). Cabinets should be avoided, since with short paws the cat can be injured when falling.</li>

                    <p>Persian cats and Munchkins were used for the breeding program, and the first crossing took place in 1996. In 2001, he contacted the TICA organization to obtain the status of an experimental breed. By 2002, the breed was only allowed to register, but Joseph left the program in 2008, and other breeders took up the baton.</p>

                                <li>The Napoleon cat breed is a very gentle and kind creature that brings the warmth of its feline heart to any home. Regardless of whether you are a lonely owner, or have a large family, these pets will make your life more interesting and filled with affection and sincere love. They can communicate with their owners using facial expressions and voice, considering themselves as a family member.

                                    These are large cats, which especially emphasizes the large amount of wool. The paws are short, muscular, but this does not prevent them from climbing into all possible places, jumping and moving around the house quite quickly. By the way, unlike Munchkin, he has noticeably less dexterity. The muzzle is rounded, wedge-shaped, ears of medium size. Life expectancy is 12 years or more.</li>

                                <li>The Minuet cat is presented in two types: short-haired and long-haired, so the level of care will be different. In general, the cat needs to be combed once or twice a week. In addition, do not forget to trim the claws on average once every 10 days, clean the ears once or twice a week, and also monitor the cleanliness of the eyes. Bathe these cats about once every 3 months or less.</li>
