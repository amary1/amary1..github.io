                    <p>
                        The Bengal cat is a hybrid of a domestic cat with a wild Asian leopard cat. The first hybrid was bred in 1963 by Jean Mill. Today, Bengalis divorce only each other.

                        The breed was recognized by the International Cat Association in 1991. The Association of Cat Lovers did not recognize the breed.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Bengal cats are mostly medium-sized, although there are also large individuals that can boast strong, athletic bodies.

                                    Along with other hybrid breeds of cats, for example Savannah, Bengal cats are larger than the average domestic cat.

                                    Adult cats can weigh 4-8 kg.

                                    Distinctive features of the "Bengalis":

                                    they have a large triangular head;
                                    the ears are small with rounded tips;
                                    the nose of Bengal cats is wide and massive;
                                    the eyes are large and take an oval shape;
                                    the neck is strong and muscular;
                                    paws are strong and large. They are medium-sized, but slightly longer at the back than at the front;
                                    the tail of this breed is small;
                                    the cat's coat is silky and dense. It can be short or medium-sized;
                                    the color is marble or leopard and can have a shade of gray, red or white.</li>

                                    It's easy to take care of a happy Bengal cat, as they like to swim, are easy to train and therefore will not sharpen their claws on your chairs and sofas. It is easy to get used to the tray, but keep in mind that it must be closed or have high sides, since Bengals like to bury their "waste".</li>

                    <p>
                        This is really an incredible breed of cats that deserves special attention. Created in the USA in 2007 in the laboratory of Lifestyle Pets, Asher has become a real gem in the world of domestic furry friends.

                        This breed was conceived to be exceptionally large and unique. The initiator of the project was Simon Brody, an entrepreneur who decided to fulfill his dream of creating something truly exclusive. Together with a team of geneticists, he set to work.

                        However, the official history of Asher breeding remains in the shadows. Despite the relatively recent appearance of this breed, many details remain a mystery. However, according to information from breeders, Asher is the result of crossing domestic cats, an African serval and an Asian leopard cat similar to a Bengal cat.

                        The history of the Asher breed is shrouded in mysticism and uncertainty, and this only gives it an additional charm. Disputes about its origin led to the fact that the Lifestyle Pets company discontinued the breeding program in June 2008. Nevertheless, they continue to position this breed as the largest, rarest and most exotic domestic cat in the world.

                        Regardless of its origin, the Asher remains a unique and fascinating breed that has captured the hearts of cat lovers around the world. Her beauty and mystery make her a real pearl among domestic fluffy companions.</p>

                                    The cat of the Asher breed impresses with its majestic size, which led to the fact that the Lifestyle Pets company recognized it as the largest among all cat breeds. Its weight can vary from 12 to 15 kilograms, which makes this cat a real giant among cats.

                                    But the size of the Asher is not limited only by weight. These cats have an impressive height, reaching about 150 centimeters, which is equal to 1.5 meters. This makes the breed comparable in size to an average or even large dog.</li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Asher's cat is a playful and intelligent breed that can even learn to walk on a leash. In order to keep her in good physical and mental shape, do not forget to provide her with interactive toys for cats.

                                    Do not forget that Asher has an infinite supply of energy and curiosity, so it is important to keep her constantly busy and active. Otherwise, she will easily come up with her own entertainment, which may not always be pleasant and favorable for you and your home.

                                    So play, train and chat with your Asher so that you both have a bright and happy cat life!</li>

                    <p class=" h5 text-primary">Elf cat</p>
                    <p>The work and research were conducted for three years - from 2004 to 2006. The work was not in vain - the elf cat really has a unique appearance, although it has some external similarities with other hairless cats. Today there are very few of these pets, and therefore it is safe to say that this is a rare breed. By the way, Karen Nelson was allergic to cats, but with the appearance of the first little elf, she discovered that her allergy was powerless here.</p>

                                <li>If you want a really unusual pet to live at home, which is more suitable for Martian landscapes - an elf cat is the right choice. On the one hand, they require more care and supervision, on the other hand, they are a rare breed, which, moreover, has an excellent character. They will become an interesting and fun addition to your family.

                                    The elf cat has a slim, elegant build, a medium-length tail, large, non-standard ears and huge, expressive eyes. The muzzle is wedge-shaped, somewhat non-standard shape, elongated and thin. There are folds all over the body, the amount of wool can vary from its complete absence to a very short cover with thin hair. The average life expectancy is 12-16 years.</li>

                                <li>It is not necessary to comb out elves, however, like all hairless cats, the skin must be wiped with a damp cloth (without alcohol) during the day. Their ears need to be wiped at least once a week, and preferably twice a week, with great care, with water diluted with vinegar 1 \ 1.

                                    Elves are bathed once or twice a month (with the right shampoo, since the skin of elves is sensitive), depending on the contamination of the skin - this is determined by the smell, apparently contamination of the folds and the skin as a whole, as well as by its stickiness. Do not forget to trim the claws on average once every 10 days, and also clean the eyes of deposits. These cats should be protected from direct sunlight and protected from the cold.</li>
