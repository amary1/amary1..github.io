                    <p class=" h5 text-primary">British Shorthair, Highlander, Highland Straight, Britannica</p>
                    <p>It is believed that these cats appeared in Britain together with the Roman colonizers who came after the conquest of the islands by Julius Caesar in 43 AD - 60 AD. The Romans, as they advanced, built fortified camps, roads, cities, developed infrastructure and constantly seized new territories.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The British Shorthair cat is a good friend and affectionate pet. Life expectancy is on average 15 years, but with proper care it can increase to 20 years.

                                    The classic shade of wool is considered gray-blue, but there are a lot of others (black, chocolate, white, lilac, striped, etc.). It is believed that Persian cats played a big role in the formation of colors - mating with them occurred quite often, both in the early 20th century and in the post-war years.

                                    The ears are short, neat, well-shaped, the classic and most common eye color is orange, but in some colors they can also be blue (one or both eyes). Their gaze has sincerity and charm. The body is short, strong,, the paws are strong and also short, although, in general, the British are very harmoniously built. These cats do not like being squeezed too much or carried around a lot, although they are responsive and love affection. Dogs are well perceived if they do not show aggression.</li>

                                <li>The British shorthair cat does not require special care. Weekly cleaning of the wool with a brush and that's all you need to keep the wool in good condition.

                                    It is also important to check your ears regularly and clean them if necessary.</li>

                    <p>The Scottish fold cat is a unique breed in its own way, as it has a very non-standard shape of the ears, which is reflected in the name itself. Also, it is clear from the name that the homeland of these pets is Scotland, namely, a farm in the Tayside area, near the town of Cupar Angus.</p>
                    <div class="media mt-3">

                                <li>Scottish Fold will be a wonderful companion for the whole family, and an affectionate friend of children. At the same time, the cat will feel great if she has one owner, giving him all the kindness of her soul. These cats live an average of 15 years, and retain playfulness even in adulthood. The body is medium-sized, the paws are short, strong, the build is correct and harmonious.

                                    Health problems require close attention from the first months of a kitten's life, however, the percentage of deviations in pets according to recent studies is getting smaller from year to year. Apparently, natural selection plays a role, therefore, without fear, get a cat of the Scottish Fold breed. Colors can be completely different - in this regard, you have a huge freedom of choice.</li>

                                <li>Since the Scottish fold is mainly shorthair cats, in many ways their care is simplified. Once a week, the wool should be combed with a brush, and this is enough. On the other hand, there is also a long-haired variety of this breed, which originated from mating with Persian cats, and their wool should be combed more often and carefully.

                                    Ears deserve special attention, because of the peculiarities of their structure. They need to be cleaned at least several times a week, with extreme care and accuracy, and it is highly desirable that this be done by the person the cat trusts the most. Also, once a week you need to trim your claws, and teeth cleaning is ideally carried out every day, or at least several times a week.</li>

                    <p>The Maine Coon breed comes from the state of Maine in the United States of America. It is believed that these cats were descendants of domestic shorthair cats that crossed with Scandinavian ones brought to North America by the Normans. Thus, the Maine Coon breed may be related to the Norwegian forest cat.

                        The ancestral origin of the Maine Coon breed is unknown - there are only assumptions and legends.</p>

                                <li>The Maine Coon is an extremely large cat. Males of this breed weigh 6-10 kg, and females 4-7 kg. The height of adults can vary from 25 to 41 cm, and they can reach a length of up to 120 cm, including the tail, which can be up to 36 cm in length.

                                    The body is well developed, muscular and with strong legs to support its own weight. Maine Coons have a rectangular body shape and slowly develop physically. Their full potential size is usually reached in three to five years, while in other cats it takes about one year.</li>

                                <li>Maine Coons have a fine coat that needs weekly cleaning to keep it in good condition and prevent the formation of any tangles.

                                    Like other long-haired breeds, the Maine Coon sheds a lot in spring and autumn, so more frequent cleaning will not hurt.

                                    You also need to check and clean your ears regularly so that you don't get treated for ear infections later.

                                    Special attention should be paid to high-quality food for Maine coons, so that it meets all their nutritional needs.</li>
